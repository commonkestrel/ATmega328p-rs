# atmega

A small project for controlling the ATmega328p microcontroller (The microcontroller in the Arduino Uno) with Rust.
Not quite finished, but this works well enough to make simple programs.

## Should I use this?
If you are looking for a higher level, easy to use interface with the ATmega328p, this is the crate for you.
If you want an auto-generated low-level interface to dozens of microcontrollers including the ATmega328p, [ruduino](https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino).
